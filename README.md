## Projects
### 1. Austin Animal Shelter Intake Analysis

A comprehensive class project analyzing seasonal trends in over 150,000 animal intakes at the Austin Animal Center, focusing on seasonal and species-specific patterns. Correlation and regression analyses revealed temperature as a key driver of intake trends, providing insights for data-driven resource allocation and operational planning.

### 2. SIG Financial Forecasting

This notebook highlights financial forecasting material that I taught during my time as Director of Quantitative Analysis for the Sustainable Investment Group (SIG) at UCSD. While not all of the material could be preserved, this notebook is representative of the quality and themes of the content I developed and presented. It includes modules on GARCH and ARIMA modeling for volatility and returns forecasting, as well as Sharpe ratio and beta analysis for portfolio and risk evaluation. The workflows showcase forecasting methods, data manipulation, and teaching-oriented examples of applied finance. 

### 3. World Series Analysis

An applied project using historical World Series data to explore trends, predictive modeling, and statistical inference in sports analytics. Workflow demonstrates time series analysis, visualization, and longitudinal hypothesis testing for operating decision-making within the MLB
